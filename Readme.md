Wandering through Stack overflow I came across to simply clever solution which employs just old-fashioned threads wrapping synchronous requests. What stroke me down is the possibility to supply a call-back function that reminds AJAX of asynchronous requests. Of course, this pattern you can employ in any I/O bound operation, which consumes time and resources, leaving the main thread active, for example, for some UI animation which can be stopped in the call-back function
